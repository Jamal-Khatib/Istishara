Flutter app that connects the clients to experts to ask for advice by either posting a question and waiting for an interested expert
or searching for an expert directly based on his rating and skills in his profile. 
The communication between the client and the expert is done inside the app via the chat, where they can send text messages, images, and documents such as pdfs.
Then the client will rate the expert based on his experience.
